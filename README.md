# FashionCatalog

Hello, this project main parts are:
<br/>1)C# web crawler that store products into a database
<br/>2)Website that acceses database
<br/><br/>This website aims to provide you with an environment where you can access clothing items you like from all of the top fashion brands in one location. By doing this, you can find what you're looking for without having to visit multiple websites.

<br/>To keep all of the products that my web crawler collects, I utilise a SQL server. Then, I use a DBcontext on my website to access that database and display the product details (Store, Name, Price, Image, Category). The product can then be clicked to take you back to its original website where you can make a purchase.
<br/><br/>You can favourite things to receive notifications about sales for them through the account system that is in place for future feathers.
